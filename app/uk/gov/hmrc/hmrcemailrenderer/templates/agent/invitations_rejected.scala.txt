Your authorisation request was declined

Dear @params("agentName")

Your client @params("clientName") has declined your request to:
 @for(service <- List(params("serviceItsa").toString, params("serviceVat").toString, params("serviceIrv").toString).filter(_.nonEmpty)) {
   - @service
 }

What you need to do next

If you think this is a mistake, sign in to your HMRC agent services account and start a new authorisation request for this client.

Do not reply to this email.
